// coop/dev/container_selftest.h -- an instrument for the container contents lane
// (`[dev] container_selftest=1`, or `VOTVCOOP_CONTAINER_SELFTEST=1` per run; it MUTATES the world).
//
// An idle two-peer run cannot exercise this lane: nobody opens a container, and a save load fills
// `saveSlot.GObjStack` wholesale rather than through the watched verbs, so the lane's central claim
// -- that the `addObject`/`takeObj` watch ENTERS on each peer -- stays invisible to it.
//
// It dispatches `prop_container_C::extract(0)` and nothing else, because extract's first act is
// `propInventory->takeObj(...)` dispatched blueprint-internally: the call WE make is the outer one
// and the mutation to be caught is the game's own inner dispatch. The host fires at +10 s on the
// nearest non-empty container to its own body, the client at +25 s on the second-nearest
// (`VOTVCOOP_CONTAINER_FIRE_MS` overrides that delay); both print a DIGEST every 5 s and one
// VERDICT fifteen seconds after their own fire. RED means the trigger changed nothing or the watch
// never fired -- the two failures that void every other line in the run.

// flag off, before the session connects, or once both dispatches have fired.

// (the one component that mechanism must never touch) and the refusal reason. That is a read-only
// predicate under the same flag: no dispatch, no write path.
